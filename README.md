# Data Science in Finance - Project

This GitHub repository contains the Python notebooks designed to partially replicate the paper [Empirical Asset Pricing via Machine Learning by Gu, Kelly and Xiu (2020).](https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/33/5/2223/5758276?login=true)

The following notebooks can be accessed:

* **Data Preprocessing**: This notebook aims to replicate all the major preprocessing steps outlined in the paper. This includes creating interaction terms, scaling variables, generating dummy variables, lagging macroeconomic predictors, and more. By downloading the relevant CSV files, accessible via a shared OneDrive folder, it is possible to obtain three distinct CSV files. These files contain the Dependent variable 'y' (representing excess returns), Features, and stock weights required for portfolio analysis. For the sake of convenience, these three CSV files are directly provided in the shared folder. This allows the modeling process to be executed promptly without the need for manual CSV file creation.

* **Modelling**: This notebook contains all the models included in the papers together with some additional ones implemented to expand the original research.

The notebook also contains the Project Report describing in detail the data used, the methodology applied in the reaserch and the results obtain compared to the ones outlined in the paper.
